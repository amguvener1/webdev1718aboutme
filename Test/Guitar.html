<h3><u>Playing The Guitar:</u></h3>
<p>
My other hobby consists of playing an instrument called the guitar. Here's a little more information on what the guitar is and how to play it.
</p>
<p>The guitar is a fretted instrument that usually consists of six strings. Each of the strings vary in thickness, which creates different pitches.
You would play the guitar by strumming or plucking the strings with either your fingers or a pick. The way that the sound is projected through the guitar is by the soundhole
if it is an acoustic guitar or a guitar amp if it is an electric guitar. A guitar could also have steel or nylon strings, both have a different sound to them.
</p>
<p>
There are also three main types of modern acoustic guitars: the classical guitar, which has nylon strings, steel-string guitar, and archtop guitar, also called jazz guitar.
There are also different types of electric guitars: hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars, and solid-body guitars.
