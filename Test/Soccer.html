<h3><u>Soccer:</u></h3>
<p>
Soccer is one of my biggest hobbies and interests, and is one that I would recommend anyone to start playing. If you don't know much about the sport here's a little insight as to how the
the game is played.
</p>
<p>
A soccer game consists of eleven players from each team. There are ten field players and one goalkeeper. The objective of soccer is to score a goal in the opponent's goal. Every goal is 
worth one point. The team that has the most goals in the end is the winner of the game.
</p>

<p>
There are also some rules to soccer that may not be so familiar. In soccer you are not allowed to use your hands. Also for every foul that is commited that team gets a
free kick. If the foul occurs inside the box, which is an 18 yard rectangle surrounding the goal, then a penalty is awarded. A penalty is a free shot on goal from 12 yards away.
There is also a rule called offsides which is where a player of the opposing team is in front of the last defender, or last field player behind the goalkeeper. 
Also for fouls commited there are consequences-they consist of cards, one is yellow and the other is red. A yellow card is just a warning, but if you get a red card you are
automatically kicked out from the game. For the remainder of the game the team has to play a player down.
